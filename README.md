## Goals & Internship Overview

I am currently interning at the **Information Access Center**, where I am exploring **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  

The main objectives of my internship are to:  
- Develop practical skills in AI model development, fine-tuning, and deployment.  
- Explore the challenges and limitations of domain-specific chatbots, particularly for educational applications.  
- Build a foundational understanding that will allow me to create AI tools relevant to Bhutanese history and other local content.  
- Document my learning journey in a structured and professional manner, showcasing my progress week by week.  

This internship is not only a technical learning opportunity but also a chance to align with **responsible AI practices**, understanding how models can be combined with external knowledge sources to create reliable educational systems.
