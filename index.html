           <p><strong>AI & Natural Language Processing Internship Portfolio</strong></p>

    <p>
      This website documents my internship journey in Artificial Intelligence,
      with a focus on Natural Language Processing, language models, fine-tuning
      techniques, and responsible AI development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My broader goal is to explore how AI can be applied meaningfully in
      education, particularly through projects such as a Bhutan History chatbot,
      while building a strong conceptual and technical foundation.
